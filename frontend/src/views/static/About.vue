        <h2 class="title is-4">Concept</h2>
        <p>The concept of Urban Food is based on several trends. Above all, it was important to us to convey a green image. Not only the design of the website is meant, but also the products and ingredients which are from sustainable sources. </p>
        <p>The offer is designed in such a way that everyone can find something tasty, but nobody is overwhelmed in their choice.</p>
        <p>The offer should be of high quality and the products should have a certain premium charm, but still be affordable. Every product is carefully thought out.</p>
        <h2 class="title is-4">Background</h2>
        <p>Urban Food was originally a project that I developed during my apprenticeship as part of a basic training year. At that time, we were still using PHP in combination with MySQL. The original site is still online: <a href="https://urbanfood.herokuapp.com/">urbanfood.herokuapp.com</a></p>
        <p>Recently I decided to learn some new technologies and experiment with them. This resulted in a new version of Urban Food. In doing so I adopted the old concept of Urban Food.</p>
